## Description

## Project Description

The Guest List Manager is a simple frontend project built using HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript. It was created to demonstrate dynamic DOM manipulation,
event handling, and responsive design in a real-world scenario.

This project allows users to:

- Add names to a guest list.
- Mark guests as "confirmed" (RSVP).
- Edit guest names inline.
- Remove guests from the list.

The goal of this project was to practice building a dynamic 
and interactive UI without relying on frameworks like React or Vue—just 
plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
